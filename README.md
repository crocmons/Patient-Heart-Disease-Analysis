<p>In this data analytics project, I explored a dataset containing information about patients and their heart health. After loading and inspecting the data, I conducted thorough data cleaning by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved visualizations and insights into various factors affecting heart health, such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.</p>

<h2>Key steps in the project include:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values.</li>

<li>Data Exploration: Utilized visualizations like bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to analyze the distribution and relationships among variables.</li>

<li>Descriptive Statistics: Utilized the describe() method to gain statistical insights into the dataset.</li>

<li>Visualization: Created visually appealing charts to showcase the relationship between age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and the likelihood of heart disease.</li>

<li>Styling and Save: Improved visual aesthetics by changing plot styles and saved a final figure for future reference.</li>
</ul>

The project provides a comprehensive view of the dataset, helping to identify potential patterns and correlations that may contribute to our understanding of heart disease factors.
